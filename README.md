# 🧾 To-Do List App (Python)

A simple **command-line To-Do List application** built in Python.  
This project was created as part of my **Code First Girls Python course** to practice core programming concepts such as loops, file handling, and exception handling.

## 🚀 Features

✅ View all tasks

✅ Graceful error handling for invalid input

## 💡 How It Works

The app runs entirely in your terminal or command prompt.  
It reads and writes tasks to a local file called **`tasks.txt`**, so your to-do list persists between runs.

## ⚙️ How to Run the App
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/todo-list-app.git
cd todo-list-app
